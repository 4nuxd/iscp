# Deployment Strategy for Real-time PII Defense

## Overview
Deploy the PII detector and redactor solution primarily as an API Gateway plugin positioned at the network ingress layer. This ensures all incoming and outgoing traffic is scanned and sanitized before entering backend services or internal tools.

## Key Deployment Layers

### 1. API Gateway Plugin (Primary Enforcement)
- **Placement:** At the API Routes Proxy level, intercepting all `/api/*` requests and responses.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Centralized PII filtering across all microservices and integrations.  
  - Low latency due to edge processing.  
  - Scalable by horizontally scaling the proxy.  
  - Simplifies updates and management by having one enforcement point.

### 2. Optional Sidecar or DaemonSet
- Deploy alongside backend service pods or as a cluster-wide DaemonSet to monitor and redact PII in logs, dashboards, and internal data streams.
- Provides additional layer for unstructured data and internal tooling.

## Justification
- **Scalability:** Gateway plugin scales with API proxy infrastructure.  
- **Latency:** Minimal overhead as filtering occurs before backend processing.  
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Avoids code changes in multiple microservices.  
- **Ease of Integration:** Uses existing API routing infrastructure, no client-side or frontend changes needed.

## Summary
Positioning PII redaction at the network ingress (API gateway) provides robust, scalable, and maintainable protection covering all system interaction points, with optional internal monitoring for enhanced security.
